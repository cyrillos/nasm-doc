\xsection{whatis}{What Is NASM?}

The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed
for portability and modularity. It supports a range of object file
formats, including Linux and ``*BSD a.out'', ``ELF'', ``COFF'',
``Mach-O'', 16-bit and 32-bit ``OBJ'' (OMF) format, ``Win32'' and
``Win64''. It will also output plain binary files, Intel hex and
Motorola S-Record formats. Its syntax is designed to be simple and
easy to understand, similar to the syntax in the Intel Software
Developer Manual with minimal complexity. It supports all currently
known x86 architectural extensions, and has strong support for macros.

NASM also comes with a set of utilities for handling the ``RDOFF''
custom object-file format.
